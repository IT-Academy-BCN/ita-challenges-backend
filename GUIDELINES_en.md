# 2. WORK PROCEDURES

## 2.1 First things to do in the project
### 2.1.1. Add your name and GitHub to the  contributors.md file

1. Clone the ita-challenges-backend repository from GitHub to your local system:

         git clone https://github.com/IT-Academy-BCN/ita-challenges-backend.git
2. Change to the cloned repository directory:

         cd ita-challenges-backend
3. Make sure you are on the "develop" branch. You can check the available branches and your current branch by executing the following command:

         git branch
4. If you aren't on the "develop", switch to it by executing the following command:

         git checkout develop
5. Create a new branch with your name to make a changes:

         git checkout -b branch-name
   Remplace "branch-name"  with a descriptive name indicating  the changes you plan to make


6. Open the "contributors.mdf" file and add your name and your GitHub.


7. After doing a git add and git commit, do the following git push:

         git push origin nombre-de-su-rama
8. Open the GitHub repository in GitHub and you should see a message that allows you to create a "pull request" from yout newly created branch to the "develop" branch. Click the link to create the pull request.


<hr/>

### 2.1.2. Import data into MongoDB (Example for micro itachallenge-challenge data)

1. Make sure you have the MongoDB Tools installed. If you don't already have them, go the "Required programs" section and folow the instructions provided to download them to your operting system.

2. Now that you have the MongoDB Tools installed, open the MongoDB terminal by running the following command:

         mongosh

3. Use the following command to change to the "admin" database:

         use admin

4. Once inside the "admin" database, paste the following code block:

         db.createUser({
         user: "admin_challenge",
         pwd: "BYBcMJEEWw5egRUo",
         roles: [
         { role: "dbOwner", db: "challenges" }
         ]
         });
   
5. Execute the following command to see if the user has been created successfully:

         show users

6. Exit the MongoDB terminal by typing the following command:

         exit

7. Connect to Mongo (maybe with MongoDB Compass) with user created at point 4

8. Create the collections "challenges", "languages" and "solutions" at "challenges" database. Use the following command to create the database "challenges":

         use challenges

9. Import the data from each collection, following option "Add Data" at Compass. Or, if you prefer, you can use the terminal with the following command:

         mongoimport --db challenges --collection challenges --file challenges.json --jsonArray --username admin_challenge --password BYBcMJEEWw5egRUo
         mongoimport --db challenges --collection languages --file languages.json --jsonArray --username admin_challenge --password BYBcMJEEWw5egRUo
         mongoimport --db challenges --collection solutions --file solutions.json --jsonArray --username admin_challenge --password BYBcMJEEWw5egRUo 


10. Start MongoDB Compass, click on "Reload Data" and you should see the database correctly imported.

<hr/>

## 2.2 Git configurations

Necessary Git configurations to prevent problems

### 2.2.1 Git ignore
1. Copy file ".gitignore" from root project\
   <img src="img/Gitignore_doc.jpg" alt="Gitignore_doc.jpg" width="300"/>
2. Paste it in the PC directory (outside of project folder)
3. In Git Bash...
4. Run the command: 'git config --global core.excludesfile C:\\temp\\.gitignore'\
Where...\
'C:\\temp': is the path of the folder where the ".gitignore" file is located.\
Note! This configuration will not only serve for the current project, but also for all the projects you do with GIT.

### 2.2.2 Autocrlf
If you have a problem with a PR that modify a lot of files, >100, you need do next...
1. In Git Bash...
2. Run the command: 'git config --global core.autocrlf true'


<hr/>

## 2.3 Daily Procedure
1. Connect to Teams at 9h15
2. Make pull the "develop" branch
3. Merge "develop" with the branc you are working on
4. Coffee time at the 10h15 approx.

IMPORTANT: It's expected that in the project we will be online with the camera on from 9h15 to 13h15, to work as a team (execpt for circumstance that justify it).

<hr/>


## 2.4 Work with cards Procedure
### How to assign a card
1. Sign in, on the your Github account.
2. On the "Spring Backlog" dashboard, locate the card you want to assign to yourself.
2. Click on the card to open it and see more details.
3. On the right hand side, in the "Assigness" field, if you click on "Add assigness" a drop-down list opens with all the participants of the project and you can select yourself to be assigned.
4. Once you have been assigned the card, you user profile will be displayed as the person responsible for the card.

### Column system to organize and visualize the progress of the cards
1. You can assign any card that is in the "Todo" column as long as it is free..
2. When you start working with the card, you should move it to the "Doing" column.
3. When the card task has been completed and you have PR'd it to the "develop" branch, you can move the card to the "Testing" column to indicate that it is ready to be tested.
4. Finally, when your PR has been accepted and, therefore, the card has passed testing, it will be moved to the "Done" column. This indicates that the card has been successfully completed.

### I already have a card assigned. Now what do I do?
1. Open your terminal or command line and navigate to your project's directory. Make sure you are in the "develop" branch.


2. Create a new branch using the format "feature#cardnumber". This refers to the Spring Backlog card number. For example:

         git checkout -b feature#123
3. Now you can start making changes to your branch.


4. Once you have made the necessary modifications push your branch to the remote repository. If we were in feature#123 we should do:   

         git push origin feature#123

5. Finally, go to GitHub where your repository is located and create a pull request from your "feature#123" branch to the "develop" branch.

<hr/>


## 2.5 Points to consider when doing a PR
1. On the pull request creation page, select the base branch and the compared branch:
   - The base branch is the branch you want to merge your changes to. In this case it is the "develop" branch.
   - The compared branch is the branch that contains your changes.
2. Provide a description of the changes you have made. Be clear and concise.
3. When you have finished completing the pull request information, click the green "Create pull request" button to create the pull request.
4. You will then see an analysis of the build. If the analysis passes successfully, a green tick will be shown in the result. On the contrary, if it detects problems in the code, a red cross will be shown. In this case, click on "Details" and see where the problem is.
5. SonarCloud will also analyze your code. It will provide you with information about bugs, vulnerabilities, security hotspots and code smell. The converage must be equal or higher than 80.0%.
6. In case you need to review and fix some problems, update your local branch with the changes and push back to the corresponding remote branch.
7. The pull request will be automatically updated with the new changes made to your branch.

# 3. URL NORMALIZATION
In this project, it is important to follow certain conventions when establishing the structure and nomenclature of the URL's used in the backend.

## 3.1 Conventions

The following are the conventions to be followed when normalizing URLs:

- **Pluralization**: It is recommended to use plural names for resources in URL's. For example, instead of "/challenge", "/challenges" would be used.

- **Use of nouns**: Nouns should be used instead of verbs in resource names to maintain a consistent structure. For example, "/challenges" instead of "/get-challenges".

- **Separators**: The use of hyphens ("-") as a separator for words in URLs has been established. For example, "/bcn-zones."

- **Consistency in lowercase**: URL's must follow a lowercase convention. For example, "/challenges" in lowercase instead of "/Challenges" or "/CHALLENGES".

- **Avoid special characters**: Avoid special characters in URLs and use alphanumeric characters instead.

- **Versioned**: If versioning of the API is required, consider including the version in the URL. For example, "/itachallenge/api/v1/challenge" for version 1 of the challenges API.

- **Versioned**: If versioning of the API is required, consider including the version in the URL. For example, "/itachallenge/api/v1/challenge" for version 1 of the challenges API.

- **Avoid verbs in URLs**: In general, it is recommended to avoid including verbs in URLs and use the appropriate HTTP methods to perform actions on resources.

- **Consistency with attribute names**: The attribute names used in URLs should be consistent with the names used in the data model.

- **Avoid excessively long URLs**: Avoid using excessively long URLs and try to keep them concise and meaningful.


## Examples

Here are example of how URL's should be strucutrued according to esablished conventions:

- `/challenges` - Get a list of all challenges.
- `/challenges/{challengeId}` - Get the details of the challenges with ID 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000.
- `/challenges/{challengeId}/update` - Edit challenge details with ID 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000.
